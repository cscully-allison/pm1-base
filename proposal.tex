%% Abstract section - 5 pts
\abstract{
In the HPC domain, a problem that plagues execution trace visualizations is an inability to meaningfully render communications on Gantt charts for modern supercomputers. The number of concurrent processors being monitored makes it impossible to draw all communication connections at once. This is problematic as understanding communication between processes is crucial to optimizing programs which use these HPC resources and must be as performant as possible. To better understand this problem we propose a within-subjects study designed to evaluate what repeated marks may be necessary and which may be redundant in displaying commonly found HPC communication patterns. This experiment will be piloted and iterated on until it is ready to be deployed to a large base of users so that meaningful data can be collected. Data collected from this experiment can help inform a design study which will produce a better Gantt chart. One that can represent communications data at scale.

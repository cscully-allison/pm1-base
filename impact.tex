\section{Impacts}
\label{sec:impact}

The primary impact of this research is quantifying how people derive meaningful information from marks of lines and patterns of lines, specifically in the context of tracing communication in parallel programs. Even if the data obtained from this experiment supports common sense expectations, this work can then be used to justify design decisions made by future iterations of existing Gantt chart visualization software.

More concretely, the conclusions drawn from this work can be leveraged to inform a guided design study with the goal of building a better Gantt chart that effectively visualizes communication at large scales. Innovation on this front can significantly impact contemporary profiling workflows with large, distributed supercomputer clusters. If future profiling visualization software can show these communication patterns using more succinct notation, domain professionals will be able to locate bottlenecks significantly faster than current software allows for.
